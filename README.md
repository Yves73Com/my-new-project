# Helpful AI for deaf people

Building AI course project 

## Summary

Deaf people who don't use the sign language because they haven't been taught, read lips to understand what a person is saying and are often limited in expressing themselves because of a basic vocabulary and a particular sound of the voice. 
An AI application tool could help deaf people with limited understanding and limited use of spoken/written language to develop greater knowledge and consequently greater self-confidence.
This idea has been developed for deaf people, but may also be suitable for hard-of-hearing individuals and those with similar conditions.


## Background

Given that deafness prevents the natural acquirement of spoken language, deaf children suffer from linguistic deprivation if not exposed to accessible input.
Some deaf people do not read, write and talk correctly because of this, not due to intellectual limitations.
A common prejudice is that deaf people are also mute, but unless there are vocal organ pathologies, they can speak. 
A particular modulation of the voice is due to the difficulty of reproducing sounds without being able to hear them.
My idea of AI for deaf people is an app to be used on portable devices such as tablets, smartphones, smartwatches and (why not) augmented reality glasses that can help develop the voice and gradually provide information to a specific word or sentence.


## How is it used?

Think of an app for learning a foreign language and make it accessible to deaf people to better learn their primary language: this kind of apps are based on the sound of the words that people say and are marked as correct or uncorrect before moving on to the next level. 
To make it functional for deaf people, a video of a person showing how to move the mouth and tongue to better pronounce words could be useful, if not even fundamental.
Furthermore, this app could simultanously transcribe the words being said by the interlocutor (the person who talks to a deaf), translating them at the level of knowledge achieved.
To help the deaf person learn more, AI could suggest more information on a given topic (e.g. a place, a historical fact, etc.), always in an understandable way.


## Data sources and AI methods

Since I am not an advanced AI user or creator, I cannot include data sources or AI methods.
And, by the way, my source of inspiration is real human life with its pros and cons.


## Challenges

The main challange is to make a reality this idea of mine, which is useful in theory.


## What next?

I'm not so technically skilled to present my project with codes and AI-generated images or videos, so I am counting on the people who will read this to bring their own vision and suggestions to eventually make an AI tool that I believe could help many people.
